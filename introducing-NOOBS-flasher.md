# Introducing... NOOBS FLASHER!

## What is NOOBS Flasher?
NOOBS Flasher is a Python program that flashes NOOBS to a micro SD card.  

### Why did I make it?  
I made NOOBS Flasher because I needed to flash NOOBS to my Raspberry Pi. I thought it would be cool to make a program that does it automatically.

### Where can I find the program?  
The Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/slashtechno/noobs-flasher).
