# BACKUP AN EXTERNAL USB TO GOOGLE DRIVE
My current setup for my SSD, is Ubuntu, Kali Linux, and  and a 100 GB partition for normal file storage. Using Ubuntu, I am backing this up to Google Drive daily using the Déjà Dup Backup Tool. This is how you can also backup an external drive.

1. Open the Backups tool on Ubuntu

2. Select "Storage Location"

3. From the drop down, select Google Drive

4. Choose whatever folder name you would like (this will appear in your Google Drive)

5. Go to "Folders to Save"

6. Select the current folder ("This should be your home directory)

7. Press the dash at the bottom

8. Press the plus at the bottom

9. Go to your drive and select "Add"

10. Go to Scheduling and select whatever you want

11. Go to overview and press Backup Now

12. Now it will ask permission to install a Python Dependency (Allow It)

13. Now sign in to your Google Account.
