# Windows Privacy
### Windows and privacy are never in the same sentence.

So I booted into Windows from Ubuntu (I have a dual boot with 2 SSDs) and I needed to sign in with Microsoft. This is not the first time this has happened. When I need to make a Windows VM, I am asked to sign in with a Microsoft acount. When was the last time Linux asked you to sign in? Now, Windows is just becoming an advertising and data collecting service for Microsoft.

If more developers were to allow their software to easily be installed on Linux, it would allow for much more flexiblity. For example, Discord, Firefox, Github, Steam, Chrome, Brave, etc all have support for Linux. Even better, it is even simpler to install than on Windows.

In the end, unless more developers start publishing software for Linux, this problem will remain. Or Microsoft could make Windows Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
