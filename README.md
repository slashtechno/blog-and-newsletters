Backup of my blog posts and newsletters across platforms.

## Why I made this
So I have been using diffrent platforms for blog hosting. Now I am using Substack and Github Pages with Publii. However, if I need to move to a diffrent hosting provider (or I self host) I want to have a backup of my blog posts. Even better, I can easily back it up using my [Github backup script](https://github.com/slashtechno/github-backup).
