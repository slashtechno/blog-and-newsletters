# blog-and-newsletters
Backup of my blog posts and newsletters across platforms.

# UPDATE:
I have started to reconsider if I want to have a blog and newsletter, this repository may not be updated

## Why I made this
So I have been using diffrent platforms for blog hosting. Now I am using Substack and Github Pages with Publii. However, if I need to move to a diffrent hosting provider (or I self host) I want to have a backup of my blog posts. Even better, I can easily back it up using my [Github backup script](https://github.com/slashtechno/github-backup).
